/*time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of 
time taken by a program to run as a fuction of length of 
the input.
space complexity of a program does not depend upon the input 
of the primitive datatypes but on the variables in the 
program
though it depends upon the input of the datatypes like 
array as we have to define the size of the array while 
initialising the array.
